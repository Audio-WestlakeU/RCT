# RCT-Random-Consistency-Training
Welcome to RCT-Random consistency training! This is the official implementation of RCT.


## Introduction
***
RCT is a semi-supervised training secheme for Sound Event Detection (SED). But we believe it has a more generalized
usage for other applications!

Since the code is constructed for SED, we build RCT based on the baseline model for DCASE 2021 challenge. Please refer
to [[1]](https://github.com/turpaultn/DESED) and [[2]](https://github.com/DCASE-REPO/DESED_task) for more details. 

Here, we will only give a lite introduction of the baseline model. The structure of RCT is given below:
